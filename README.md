# aeroCMS
## What is it?

aeroCMS is a lightweight (not yet finished) Content Management System which is programmed object-oriented.

## Features?

It already features a bunch of features, but there are definitely many more to come. 
Here is a short overview about what you can expect: 

* Create your own `PageController` for dynamic content
* Blog system (Database [e.g. MySQL] based)
* Page system (Database [e.g. MySQL] based)
* Responsive design (Default template will be bootstrap-based)
* Global menu generation
* Sub(-sub-sub...) menu generation
* More to come later on

## Can I already use this system? 

**Nah!** Currently this repo is more like a changelog and todo-tracker. I'm going to publish a MySQL-Database-dump later on and will create an installer to make this system usable.
