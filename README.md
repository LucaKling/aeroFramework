# aeroFramework
## What is it?

aeroFramework is a lightweight (not yet finished) Framework for websites which is programmed object-oriented.

## Features?

It already features a bunch of (technical) stuff, but there are definitely many more features to come. 
Here is a short overview about what you can expect: 

* Create your own `PageController` for dynamic content
* Blog system (Database [e.g. MySQL] based) <- [LucaKling/aeroCMS](https://github.com/LucaKling/aeroCMS)
* Page system (Database [e.g. MySQL] based) <- [LucaKling/aeroCMS](https://github.com/LucaKling/aeroCMS)
* Responsive design (Default template will be bootstrap-based) <- [LucaKling/aeroCMS](https://github.com/LucaKling/aeroCMS)
* Global menu generation
* Sub(-sub-sub...) menu generation
* More to come later on

## Can I already use this system? 

**Nah!** Currently this repo is more like a changelog and todo-tracker. I'm going to publish a MySQL-Database-dump later on and will create an installer to make this system usable.
